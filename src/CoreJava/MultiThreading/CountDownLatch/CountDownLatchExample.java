package CoreJava.MultiThreading.CountDownLatch;

/*
A CountDownLatch is like a timer
that helps coordinate the completion of tasks.
Imagine you are in a race where several runners (threads) need to wait for a signal (a countdown reaching zero)
before they can start running.
The race starter (main thread) keeps track of how many runners (tasks) are participating
and waits for all of them to finish something before giving the signal to start.

In simpler terms:
================
CountDownLatch allows one or more threads to wait for a set of events to complete before proceeding.
Once the latch's count reaches zero, all threads that were waiting are allowed to proceed.
Key points:
You initialize a CountDownLatch with a specific count (number of events or tasks).
Threads call countDown() when they complete their task, reducing the count.
The main thread (or any other thread waiting) calls await() to wait until the count reaches zero.
