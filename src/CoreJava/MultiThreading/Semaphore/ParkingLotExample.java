package CoreJava.MultiThreading.Semaphore;
/*A semaphore is a tool that controls access to a particular resource
 in a multi-threaded environment. It works like a "counter"
 that manages how many threads can access a shared resource at the same time.
 Semaphores can be used for tasks like limiting the number of threads
 that can access a particular resource,
 or to synchronize actions across multiple threads.

In Java, the Semaphore class is part of the java.util.concurrent package.
It allows you to control access by multiple threads, using a counter
to determine how many threads can access a particular resource concurrently.*/
